    <h2>Nijue Smart Business Card</h2>
    <p><span class="highlighted-text">Nijue</span>, a cutting-edge NFC-based virtual business card, embodies its essence in its name derived from the Swahili word–<span class="highlighted-text">Nijue</span>– which means, "<span class="highlighted-text">Get to Know Me</span>." This core principle underpins <span class="highlighted-text">Nijue</span>'s mission to revolutionize the way professionals showcase their information and connect with others. By seamlessly integrating the power of NFC technology and QR codes, Nijue offers a dynamic and customizable online portfolio accessible through a simple tap or scan, facilitating an impressive and engaging introduction in the modern professional landscape.</p>
    
    <h3>How it Works:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ordering the Card:</strong> Individuals can order their Nijue virtual business card, specifying their name, designation, and optionally their company's logo for printing.</li>
      <li><strong>Front of the Card:</strong> The front of the card showcases the person's name, designation, and if requested, their company's logo.</li>
      <li><strong>Back of the Card:</strong> The back of the card features an NFC chip and a QR code linked to a unique URL on nijue.co.ke.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessing the Portfolio:</strong> When someone taps the card with their phone or scans the QR code, it directs them to a personalized registration page on nijue.co.ke.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile Registration:</strong> The registration page allows users to create their profile by uploading a profile picture, editing social media handles, adding contact details (phone number, email), writing a personal description, and including any relevant links.</li>
      <li><strong>Saving and Editing:</strong> Users save their information, creating a personalized online portfolio. They can log in at any time to edit or update their details, including new job titles or promotions.</li>
      <li><strong>Online Portfolio:</strong> The online portfolio showcases all the information provided, offering a comprehensive view of the individual's professional identity and contacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy Updates:</strong> If there are changes in their profile, users can simply log in, edit the necessary details, and instantly update their online portfolio.</li>
    </ol>
